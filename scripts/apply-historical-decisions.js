// Two of the three anchors are not literals — they are resolved from the record
// at a specific moment, and the moment matters:
//
//   * Shaun, 1 Jul — initial classification correction to 1400 at 10%.
//   * Tom, 1 Jul — club override to JORDS' rating immediately before the 1 Jul
//     review, at 10%. Drawn from the SHARED 1 Jul pre-review snapshot, so
//     processing Shaun first cannot move it. That is the whole reason the
//     shared-snapshot rule exists.
//   * Fatch, 1 Aug — club override to TOM's rating immediately before the
//     1 Aug review, at 10%. This one must be resolved AFTER Shaun and Tom are
//     applied and July has been replayed, because it depends on Tom's corrected
//     July trajectory. Resolving all three up front would anchor Fatch to a Tom
//     who no longer exists.
//
// So this runs in two passes with a replay between them. Everything goes
// through the audited Historical Club Adjustment path: nothing is deleted, and
// each decision supersedes the one it replaces.
