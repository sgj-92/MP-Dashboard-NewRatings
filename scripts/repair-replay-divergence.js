// Dry run is the default and writes nothing.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. Every rating in the record is derived from the stored
// matches by replaying them in order. If the stored ratings and the stored
// history ever stop agreeing, the app refuses to plan any further edit -- it
// will not build a change on top of numbers the history does not support. That
// refusal is correct, and it is also a dead end: nothing in the app can clear
// it.
//
// The failure it was written for: a replay that wrote part of its output and
// stopped. Before writes were batched, one removal sent ~500 documents one at a
// time; closing the app part-way through left the earlier documents rewritten
// and the later ones holding pre-change values. The record is not corrupt --
// every match is intact -- but the derived numbers are half-finished.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It changes no match, adds none, removes none. The
// matches are the record. This only finishes the arithmetic that hangs off
// them, so its result is whatever the record already implies. It is write-only
// by design: if the repair would need to DELETE a document, that is not a
// partial write, and it stops and says so instead.
//
// Idempotent. Run it on a healthy record and it reports nothing to do.
