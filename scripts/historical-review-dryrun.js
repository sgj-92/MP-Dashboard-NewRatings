// The board's factual position (PROJECT_LEDGER.md Open Question 17):
//   * Shaun, 1 Jul 2026 — he entered Tier C only because his level was unknown.
//     The club concluded the initial estimate was wrong. That is an
//     INITIAL_CLASSIFICATION_CORRECTION to the normal B baseline of 1400. June
//     is preserved exactly; the estimate is corrected on 1 July.
//   * Tom, 1 Jul 2026 and Fatch, 1 Aug 2026 — genuine promotions. They get the
//     same statistical reassessment a promotion would get today, calculated
//     from the shared pre-review snapshot at their own review date. They are
//     NOT re-seeded to 1400.
//
// Each recommendation is drawn from the state as it stood BEFORE that review
// date, so Shaun's correction on 1 July cannot change what Tom is offered on
// the same day.
