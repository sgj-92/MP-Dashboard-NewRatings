// DIFFERENT ENGINES, so a per-player difference is not an error in either. The
// point of the report is to make the differences legible and say which are
// explained, not to drive them toward zero. A report that presented these as a
// reconciliation would be the most misleading thing in the repository.

// receiving matches. Every figure below is printed with its date.
