// ===================== DATA FLOW =====================
// How the app gets its data onto the screen, and keeps it there.
//
// Two defects lived here for a long time, and neither was a calculation
// mistake -- every module was right and the wiring was wrong, which is why
// only a test that drives the browser can catch either.
//
//   1. A screen tapped while the record was still arriving was drawn once,
//      from nothing, and never drawn again. It stayed blank until the reader
//      navigated away and came back. Start-up ended by redrawing the rankings
//      list, which is one screen out of eleven.
//
//   2. A mutation rebuilt everything derived and then redrew whichever screen
//      its own button happened to live on. Removing one rated match moved four
//      players' ratings and changed nothing on the League Table, the Merit
//      Table, the Players Directory, Call-Outs or Head-to-Head.
//
// And one cost: fourteen independent reads taken one at a time, measured at
// 3.8s to first content on a phone, of which 16ms was computation.
