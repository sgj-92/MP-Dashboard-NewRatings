// ===================== DRAWS ARE NOT LOSSES =====================
// Money Padel has three outcomes. Screens kept writing code with two.
//
// The reported defect: the Doughnut drill-down described a recorded draw as
// "[Team] def [Team]", telling a player they had lost a game the record says
// they drew. The cause is the same everywhere it appears — on a drawn match
// `winners` and `losers` still hold the two sides, because a match has two
// sides whatever the result, but they mean nothing. The record says so
// itself: every drawn document carries `drawSideAssignmentArbitrary: true`.
// So `winners.includes(name)` answers "which side was this player filed on",
// and `won ? 'WIN' : 'LOSS'` turns that coin toss into a result.
//
// These tests use the REAL recorded draws (six of them, all September) rather
// than a fixture, and the last one checks that nothing about those records
// moved.
