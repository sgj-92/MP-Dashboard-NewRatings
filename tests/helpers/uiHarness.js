// ===================== UI HARNESS =====================
// Boots the real index.html in a real browser against a stubbed Firestore.
//
// Every UI defect found during the v3 integration -- historical tiers coming
// back undefined, expectations recomputed from today's ratings, a modal
// describing a solver that had been retired, approving a game making it vanish,
// a confirmed delete persisting an overlay and changing nothing -- was found by
// a person driving the browser. None of them could have been caught by the
// module tests, because every module was correct in isolation and the
// application wired them up wrongly. This is the layer that was missing.
//
// The stub is built from the same backfill the seed writes, so the fixture
// cannot drift from the real record and there is no data file to keep in step.
//
// It skips rather than fails when Playwright or a browser is unavailable: a
// suite that goes red on a machine without Chromium teaches people to ignore
// red.
