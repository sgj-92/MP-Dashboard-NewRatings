// A tier change and its rating consequence are one board decision.

// The rule these tests hold is that the board may not walk away from a tier
// change without saying what happens to the rating. Silence was the problem: a
// promotion recorded with no rating decision looks complete, and months later
// somebody wants to backdate the reassessment to the review that never
// finished. "Keep the current rating" is an answer, and it is recorded.
//
// The second rule is fairness between players reviewed together: a
// recommendation comes from where everyone stood BEFORE the review began.
