// ===================== MEANINGFUL MONTH =====================
// Which month a monthly competitive view should OPEN on.
//
// It used to be "last month", always. That solved a real problem -- on the
// 1st, the current month holds one game, and a league table, a podium or a
// Player of the Month built from one game is noise -- but it solved it by the
// calendar rather than by the data, so it went on showing August on the 25th
// of September, three weeks and dozens of games after September had become the
// month worth reading.
//
// The rule now asks the data: the current month is the default once it holds
// THRESHOLD canonical matches; until then the most recently completed month
// with any matches is.
//
// This module decides a DEFAULT and nothing else. It never knows what a reader
// has chosen, and nothing here may override a choice: every screen that uses
// it keeps its own chosen month and its own default separately, and asks this
// module only when a reader arrives without having chosen (see app.js,
// "WHO OWNS WHICH MONTH"). It is also evaluated on arrival and then held, so a
// fifth game landing while somebody is reading September's-too-thin August
// does not move the page under them.
//
// COUNT MATCHES, NOT APPEARANCES. Four players in one game is one game. A
// drawn match is a played, rated match and counts. A pending submission is
// neither and does not; nor does a display-only historical row.
