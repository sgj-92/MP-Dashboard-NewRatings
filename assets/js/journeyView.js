// ===================== RATING JOURNEY (display shaping) =====================
// Turns persisted ratingJourney events into the chronological story of one
// player's Power Rating. This is the REAL record, not a reconstruction: every
// figure here was written by the engine at the time and is simply read back.
//
// The disclaimer the old UI carried ("Story estimate — official Power Rating
// is X") existed because the previous journey was a separate approximation
// that could disagree with the official number. It cannot disagree now, so the
// disclaimer is gone.
//
// Two rules the display must never break:
//   * A tier change is shown as its own event and always states that the
//     Power Rating did not move. A promotion must never look like it generated
//     points.
//   * A club reassessment is shown as its own event with a distinct marker on
//     the chart. It must never masquerade as match movement.
