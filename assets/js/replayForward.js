// ===================== REPLAY FORWARD =====================
// Changing the match history means changing the inputs to everything that came
// after it. A rating is not a stored fact you can edit; it is the end of a
// sequence, and the only honest way to change one match is to re-derive every
// rating that followed from it.
//
// This module does that by rebuilding the ENGINE INPUTS from the stored record,
// applying the change, and replaying the whole thing. Not a partial replay from
// a midpoint: every input is stored, so a full re-derivation is exact and has no
// partial-state bookkeeping to get subtly wrong. 150 matches costs nothing.
//
// The proof that it can be trusted is `verifyNoOp`: replaying with NO change
// must reproduce the stored record exactly. If that ever fails, nothing else
// here means anything, so it is a test and also a runtime precondition of
// planning a real change.
//
// One subtlety, and it is the reason this module reconstructs INTENT rather
// than echoing the record. A recorded event carries `newReliability` whether or
// not it meant to change reliability, and feeding that back inverts it through
// reliability = e / (e + 10), losing a last bit (Open Question 11). So an event
// is replayed carrying a reliability change only when it actually made one.
// That is both exact and more faithful: it replays what the decision was, not
// what the arithmetic happened to record.
