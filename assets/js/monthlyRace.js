// ===================== MONTHLY RACE (Best Month) — TRIAL =====================
// Who had the best results this month, adjusted for how hard their matches
// actually were. A fifth story, deliberately separate from the other four:
//
//   Power Rating         who is strongest overall
//   Monthly Race         who had the best month against the matches they took
//   Monthly Performance  who most exceeded their OWN pre-match expectation
//   League               conventional result points
//   Merit                result points with a coarse tier-step adjustment
//
// THE RACE, AS PLAYERS HEAR IT. Everyone in a tier starts the month on 0.
// Each match has stakes, fixed by how hard it was for an ordinary player of
// your tier with your actual partner against your actual opponents: harder
// wins earn more, harder losses cost less. Highest qualified total at the end
// of the month had the best month.
//
// THE ARITHMETIC (approved 26 Sep; derivation in BEST_MONTH_ANALYSIS.md):
//
//   par    = chance that an ordinary member of your tier, in your seat, wins:
//            winChance( mean(tierPar, partner), mean(opponents) )
//   win    = K x (1 - par)        draw = K x (0.5 - par)        loss = -K x par
//
// "Ordinary member of your tier" is the tier's par rating for the month: the
// mean month-opening Power Rating of the players who played in that tier that
// month (a month-opening rating is the pre-match rating of a player's first
// match of the month). Your OWN rating never enters -- that is what keeps
// this a race to be best, not a race to beat your own expectation (which is
// Monthly Performance, and stays exactly as it is).
//
// WHAT IT NEVER TOUCHES. Nothing here reads or writes sequential-v1 state.
// Its inputs are canonical approved matches, the canonical historical-tier
// resolver and the persisted pre-match ratings the engine already recorded.
// It is derived on demand and never persisted.
//
// THE WIN CURVE IS NOT THE ENGINE'S. The engine's expectation predicts a
// blended score (80% game share), which is deliberately less extreme than who
// wins: favourites won 84% of matches where it predicted ~74%. A race about
// RESULTS needs a curve fitted to results, or it quietly pays for easier
// fixtures. Same Elo shape, scale 250 instead of 400, fitted to the club's 161
// decided matches (Sep 2026). A constant, never tuned by hand; refitting it is
// a methodology decision recorded in the Ledger.
