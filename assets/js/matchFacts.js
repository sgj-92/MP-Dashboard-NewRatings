// ===================== MATCH FACTS (read back, never recomputed) ============
// What the engine actually did in one match, indexed by match id.
//
// The application used to derive a match's expectation from TODAY's ratings:
// a logistic on the current numbers, presented as "expected ~32% of games" on a
// card about a match played in June. That is a recomputed historical
// expectation, which the project forbids outright, and it drifts every time
// anybody plays: the same past match quietly reported a different expectation
// week to week.
//
// Everything here was written at the time the match was rated and is read back
// verbatim. Two things follow that the old display could not express:
//
//   * K is per-player, so the four players in one match move by four different
//     amounts. There is no single "rating impact" for a match.
//   * A draw is rated. It is not a win or a loss for anybody, but it moves
//     ratings like any other result.
