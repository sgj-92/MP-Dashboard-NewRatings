// ===================== HISTORICAL CLUB ADJUSTMENT =====================
// The Admin-only way to record a club decision at a date that has already
// passed: a board decision entered late, a factual correction, or the repair of
// a mistake. It is deliberately a permanent tool rather than a one-off script,
// because the next time this is needed nobody will remember the script existed.
//
// It is NOT historical match correction. That repairs what happened on court.
// This records what the club decided about a player's level. Keeping them apart
// matters: one is a fact about a result, the other is a judgement, and merging
// them would let a rating be changed under cover of fixing a score.
//
// Four rules it will not bend:
//
//   * A missing statistical recommendation is not a decision. When the method
//     declines -- usually because a tier pool is too thin to place a boundary --
//     that is reported as an absence. It is never quietly turned into "keep the
//     current rating", which would put words in the board's mouth.
//   * Nothing earlier is deleted or edited. A correction is a NEW event that
//     supersedes the old one; both stay in the record, and only the later is
//     replayed. An audit trail that can be rewritten is not one.
//   * A reason and a name are required. A historical change with no account of
//     why is indistinguishable from someone editing the database.
//   * The record must replay to itself before anything is planned, and the full
//     blast radius is shown before anything is written.
