// ===================== MONTHLY VIEWS =====================
// The four monthly stories, all derived from the real chronological
// Sequential-v1 trajectory recorded in ratingJourney. There is NO monthly
// rating solver here and there must never be one: a month's rating is simply
// where the one continuous Power Rating stood at that month's boundaries.
//
//   Monthly Performance  who most exceeded their pre-match expectation
//   Rating Movement      real Power Rating at month start -> month end
//   Ranking Movement     overall and within-tier rank at those same boundaries
//   League Table         results/points — computed elsewhere, untouched here
//
// READ COST. This walks the whole journey once, because a rank at a month
// boundary needs every player's rating at that instant, including players who
// did not play that month. It is therefore loaded lazily, only when a monthly
// view is opened, and cached for the session. Ordinary player rendering still
// reads the compact `players` collection and never comes near this.
