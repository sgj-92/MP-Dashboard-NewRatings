// ===================== PLAYER STATE =====================
// One place that decides whether a player is Ranked, Idle or Inactive.
//
// The app used to call two different things "inactive":
//
//   * a player who simply has not played much lately, and
//   * a player who is not part of Money Padel at the moment.
//
// The first is temporary and says nothing about the person; the second is a
// club fact. Showing the first as "Inactive" reads as "this player has left",
// which is both wrong and, for anyone sitting out a fortnight, insulting.
//
// So the two dimensions are kept apart and never derived from one another:
//
//   PARTICIPATION  ACTIVE | INACTIVE   -- explicit club status, set by an admin
//   RANKING        RANKED | IDLE       -- derived, and only for ACTIVE players
//
// A player is RANKED when they have at least MIN_MATCHES rated matches in the
// trailing WINDOW_DAYS. Everything else about them -- tier, rating, lifetime
// matches, reliability -- is irrelevant to that question and must never be
// substituted for it. In particular, a lifetime-match minimum is a DISPLAY
// FILTER on the rankings list, not an eligibility rule; conflating the two is
// what made five genuinely active players show "#–" on their own profile.
//
// The match list is the v3 RATED set, which includes draws. A draw is rated:
// it moves every player in it. Counting only wins and losses made a player's
// eligibility depend on whether their recent games happened to finish.
