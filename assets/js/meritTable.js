// ===================== MERIT TABLE =====================
// An alternative league table. Not a rating, and not a replacement.
//
// The League Table treats every win the same. Merit asks a different question:
// HOW HARD WAS THE PARTNERSHIP YOU BEAT? A win in an even fixture is the
// baseline; beating a stronger pairing earns more, beating a weaker one earns
// less. It exists because some players routinely take the harder fixture and a
// points column cannot see that.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. Merit Points touch nothing the engine owns -- not Power
// Rating, ratingJourney, reliability, reassessment, expected game share, tier,
// or the outcome of any match. Nothing here reads a rating or an expectation;
// the only inputs are who played, who won, and what tier each player held ON
// THE DAY. They are derived on demand from canonical matches plus the
// canonical historical-tier resolver, never persisted, so there is no second
// source of truth to fall out of step.
//
// THE ONE RULE THAT IS EASY TO GET WRONG. A partnership's strength is the SUM
// of both players' tier levels, not its best player. `AC` and `BB` are equal
// strength (3+1 = 2+2), and a table built by comparing the strongest player on
// each side would call that a mismatch and be wrong about a large share of the
// club's games.
