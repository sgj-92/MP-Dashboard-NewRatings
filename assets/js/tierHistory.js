// ===================== TEMPORAL TIER HISTORY =====================
// The one implementation of "which tier was this player in on this date".
//
// Tier is temporal metadata (§9.1). Historical displays must use the tier that
// applied AT THE TIME: promoting someone in September must never rewrite them
// as Tier A in an August King of Tier B table. Anything that needs a tier for a
// past date goes through here, so the rule lives in exactly one place.
//
// A tier change never moves Power Rating or Reliability. That is enforced in
// ratingEngine.applyStateEvent(); nothing here touches ratings at all.
